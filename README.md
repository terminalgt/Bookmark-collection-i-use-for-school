Remove Extensions:
(if your at home using a school device, sit back and yoink those extensions!) (all extensions including web filtering extenstions will work)
If your at school, this may be difficult.
When in class, If your teacher is on their device, Don't use it because the teacher may get suspicious of you. It is somewhat risky to disable them when your teacher moves away from the computer such as, (going to the board, or just moving away from the computer)
If you disable it before class, the teacher shouldn't suspect a thing.
